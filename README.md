### About

This repository contains my solutions for the 
algorithm challenges in CodeWars using Python.
I started CodeWars because I realize it is not enough to
know how to code but also how to think and solve
problems using 'proper' data structures and algorithms.

Nevertheless, in terms of development and
production, I still prefer writing codes that is 
easier to understand and maintain before I worry
about the efficiency unless needed.
